# American-Sign-Language-Detection
GitHub Description for American Sign Language Detection
American Sign Language (ASL) Detection
This project focuses on detecting and recognizing American Sign Language gestures using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It is designed to bridge the communication gap for ASL users. The model identifies gestures in real-time via webcam and provides visual feedback.

Features:
Dataset Creation: Collect custom ASL gesture data using the webcam.
Model Training: Train a deep learning model for gesture recognition.
Real-Time Detection: Recognize and display ASL gestures through webcam input.
Expandable: Easily add new gestures or words to the dataset.
How to Use:
Collect Data: Run collect_imgs.py to capture images of ASL gestures.
Create Dataset: Use create_dataset.py to preprocess and organize data.
Train the Model: Run train_classifier.py to train a custom gesture recognition model.
Inference: Use inference_classifier.py to detect and display gestures in real time.
Tech Stack:
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
